  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
    <li>
      Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and
      cook for about 4-5 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through.
      Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute,
      until fragrant.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the sun-dried tomatoes, heavy cream, and chicken broth to the skillet.
      Stir to combine and bring to a simmer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Return the chicken breasts to the skillet, and cook in the creamy sauce
      for another 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to
      thicken.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and thyme over the chicken. Stir to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Garnish with fresh basil if desired. Serve the chicken with the creamy
      sauce over pasta, rice, or vegetables.
    </li>
  </ol>
